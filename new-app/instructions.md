I have made a new project called new-app. I really like the app but its a bit messy. please perform the following instructions.
- recreate the existing app, inside new-app
- the styling of the home page should be pretty much the same, but can change a little bit if it makes reuse easier
- the settings and schedules pages should be styled like the home page
- you should pull out common components along the way for all three pages. the pages can share components if they seem like sensible components to share
- the api functionality in app was fine, but needs recreating in new-app as it is a plain project at the moment
